I used process monitor to find out which file the game was writing to when I collected gold. The file shown that the game was writng to was SAVED.GAM. I found the offsets by looking up the stat value in hex and comparing it to the hex value in the binary file. I changed each value one by one to find out which stat were altered. I changed the values to 999 or 9999. In little endian hex it would be 0xE703 and 0x0f27. I had trouble figuring out that the binary file was in little endian. The result was that the stats and items were given the values that was listed for the lab assignment.
